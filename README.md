# Image Super-Resolution Project

This project focuses on implementing a deep learning model for image super-resolution, enhancing low-resolution images to high-resolution versions. The model is trained on a dataset from Unsplash and utilizes GAN and WGAN for image quality enhancement.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:
- **Link to Dataset**: [Image Super Resolution - Unsplash](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quadeer15sh/image-super-resolution-from-unsplash)
  
The dataset contains pairs of low-resolution and high-resolution images. It is well-suited for training and testing super-resolution models.
